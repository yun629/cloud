# Vast.ai Provider (Scaffolding)

This directory contains the starting point for integrating [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/) with the Brev Cloud SDK.  It was created by following the **Add a Cloud Provider** guide in the repository root and documents the expectations for filling in the remaining API plumbing (instance lifecycle, instance types, validation, etc.).

The implementation currently only exposes typed stubs so that future contributors can focus on wiring real Vast.ai API calls without redoing boilerplate.
